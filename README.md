PVZ Tower Defense

Description: 
In this game, you must defend your lawn against zombies by buying and upgrading
plants on your lawn. Plants can be purchased using sun, which is generated
by certain plants and awarded upon kill. Zombies will spawn on the right side
of the screen and walk to the left, dealing damage to the player if they reach
the left side of the map. Zombies will spawn in waves and upon completion, 
the next wave will increase in difficulty. Every 10 waves, the zombies will 
become stronger as their health will double. The objective of the game is to 
survive as long as possible and the game ends when the player runs out of 
health.

How to Run: 
There is only one file to run called 'Main File TP.py', as long as all images
are placed within the same folder as the file, the game will launch upon running
the file called 'Main File TP.py'. In order to set up the images, place the 
images within the same folder as the main file so the file can access all the
images it needs. CMU_112_graphics must also be in the same folder.
